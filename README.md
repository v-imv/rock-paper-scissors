# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a recreation of the game rock paper scissors using the JavaScript DOM.

You can see how it functions by clicking on "github-pages" under the heading "Environments".

## Purpose Of This Project
I undertook this project to practice using basic JavaScript and to learn about using the DOM.

## What I Learned
- Script Loading
- JavaScript Basics (Data Types, Variables, Operators, Arithmetic, Assignment, Functions, Loops, Methods....)
- Using the DOM to create, reference, style and append elements
- Adding basic event listeners like 'click' to elements
- Creating a new branch on a project and merging it to main to work on one feature at a time
